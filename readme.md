# Learn to program

Reference:
- https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/

This repo contains code from pine.fm/learntoprogram 

There isn't any relevant programming involved but mostly stuff on learning ruby.
This is a repo of me trying out code samples from the book.


Review how internal instance variables, initialize and parameters inside the class work, Blocks and Procs, passing blocks and procs to functions and classes.


__ There's More Than One Way To Do It.__

similar to `if` there is an `unless` statement

`if true do this`
`unless false !do this`

Thanks to Chris Pine for this.
